# Course Information

This course is recommended for students who are familiar with programming at least at the level of CS106A and want to translate their programming knowledge to Python with the goal of becoming proficient in the scientific computing and data science stack. Lectures will be interactive with a focus on real world applications of scientific computing. Technologies covered include Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and others. Topics will be chosen from Linear Algebra, Optimization, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Prior knowledge of programming will be assumed, and some familiarity with Python is helpful, but not mandatory.

## Tentative Schedule

1. Introduction to Scientific Computing, Python & NumPy
2. NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
3. Numerical Linear algebra in Python
4. Numerical Optimization in Python
5. Pandas, DataFrames
6. Scikit-learn, Tensorflow
7. TBD
8. TBD

## Prerequisites

* Prior programming experience (can be informal)
* Some familiarity with linear algebra, optimization
* [Suggested] Some familiarity with a scientific computing application (scientific simulations, machine learning, etc.)

Prerequisites are not hard (everyone starts somewhere), but if you do not yet have the above background, you'll need to do some background work on your own to keep up.

## Computer

This course will assume that you have a working Python 3 interpreter at your disposal.

If you don't have something working on your computer yet, you can ssh into [farmshare](https://srcc.stanford.edu/farmshare2)
```
ssh <user>@rice.stanford.edu
```

## Grading

This a 1-unit workshop style course, offered on a credit/no-credit basis.  To receive credit:
* Come to class and participate (we know you may have occasional conflicts)
* Make a reasonable attempt at the assignments (3 or 4 total)

The goal is to give you some practice and experience with the content of the course, without overwhelming you with work. Contact the instructor if the homework seems too long/difficult.

# Stanford Policies

## Honor Code
This course is intended to be collaborative.  You can (and should) work with other students in class and on homework.  You should turn in your own solutions (don't copy others). If you worked closely with someone or found an answer on the web, please acknowledge the source of your solution.

## Students with Documented Disabilities
Students with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: https://oae.stanford.edu/).
