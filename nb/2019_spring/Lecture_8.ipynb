    "So far, we've been working in Jupyter notebooks, which are nice and interactive. However, they can be clunky if you have lots of code. It can be annoying to have to run one cell at a time. For large codebases, most people work with Python scripts. The code in the cells below are meant to be run in Python scripts, not Jupyter notebooks. That means that they are saved in files that end in `.py` and run via the command line.\n",
