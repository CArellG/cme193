<h1>CME 193 - Scientific Python</h1>
</div>
<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>This short course runs for four weeks of the quarter (starting 1/12) and is
offered each quarter during the academic year.
<b>It is recommended for students who want to use Python in math, science,
or engineering courses</b> and for students who want to learn the basics of
Python programming, and learn about relevant applications.</p>
<p>The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with Pythonâ€™s
tools for scientific computing.
Lectures will be interactive with a focus on learning by example, and
assignments will be application-driven.
Topics covered include control flow, basic data structures, File IO, an introduction to NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and matplotlib.</p>
<p>As time and interest permit, we'll also cover some machine learning / web scraping.</p>
<h2>Course information</h2>
<p>CME 193 - Introduction to Scientific Python - Winter 2016</p>

<p>Instructor:
<a href="http://lukedeo.github.io/">Luke de Oliveira</a> (lukedeo {at} stanford {dot} edu)</p>
<p>Office hours: by appointment for now, with scheduled time TBA.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b> We will be using <a href="piazza.com/stanford/winter2016/cme193">Piazza</a> for course communication, so please sign up!</p>
<h2>Course prereqs</h2>
<p>There are no formal prerequisites.
However, past experience has shown that people with no programming experience
will struggle with the pace and have to put in a lot of hours, as if it were a three unit course.
Hence, <b>some prior programming experience in some language is strongly encouraged</b>. We <b>don't expect</b> you to be a CS major, but we do expect that a for-loop is not a foreign concept.</p>
<p>If you have no programming experience, and you still want to take to course, please consider
completing an introduction of Python on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python">Codeacademy</a>
and/or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity</a> before class starts.
This should get you up to speed!</p>
<h2>Course Policy</h2>
<p>The course consists of 8 lectures. We will rely heavily on IPython notebooks for lecture!</p>
<p>There will be two homeworks that will focus on real-world applications of the concepts learned in class. </p>
<p>You are encouraged to take the class for credit, as it forces you to practice with
Python and that's the best way to learn. However, anyone is also welcome to audit
the class!</p>
<h2>Honor code</h2>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss both exercises and
the project.
However, the homeworks should be your own work and all the code
you submit should be written by yourself.
Of course, you are free, and encouraged, to search online to solutions to
problems you run into (though not full solutions to the exercises), and
use those.
A simple example would be to look up the syntax of a <tt>for</tt> loop or how to initialize a <tt>numpy.ndarray</tt> with zeros.</p>
