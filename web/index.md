# Course description

This short course runs for four weeks of the quarter (starting 10/2) and is
offered each quarter during the academic year.
It is recommended for people who have programming experience who want to learn scientific programming and data science tools in Python.

Lectures will be interactive using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) with a focus on learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven.

## Course information

Office hours: by appointment for now, with scheduled time TBA.

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites. This means we won't check you're previous programming experience.

**However**, this quarter we are raising the difficulty of the material, and we expect a higher level of programming maturity than we have in the past.

Specifically, we expect programming *at least* at the level of CS106A, and the higher the level the better. Ideally, you've seen some Python in the past, though this is not necessary.

From the programming side, you should be confortable with:

* While Loops
* For Loops
* Dictionaries / Associative arrays
* Basic notions (variables, types, etc.)
* **The UNIX/Linux command line** - this course assumes you know your way around!

If you are fluent / very comfortable with any of

* R
* Java
* C++
* C
* Go
* Matlab
* Ruby

you should be more than fine.

From the math / statistics side, you technically don't need any exposure, but towards the end of the class, I'll be talking about data science in Python, so I will assume knowledge of linear algebra, some optimization, and some statistics / regression modeling.

If you haven't worked with Python in the past, I recommend completing an introduction of Python on [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)
and/or [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101).

## Course Policy

The course consists of 8 lectures. We will rely heavily on IPython notebooks for lecture!

There will be two homeworks that will focus on real-world applications of the concepts learned in class.

You are encouraged to take the class for credit, as it forces you to practice with
Python and that's the best way to learn. However, anyone is also welcome to audit
the class!

## Honor code

You are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss both homeworks.

However, the homeworks should be your own work and all the code
you submit should be written by yourself. Of course, you are free, and encouraged, to search online to solutions to
problems you run into (though not full solutions to the exercises), and
use those.

A simple example would be to look up the syntax of a `for` loop or how to initialize a `numpy.ndarray` with zeros.
