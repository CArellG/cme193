#Syllabus

This is a course on scientific computing using Python.  We'll cover aspects of the Python language as they are relevant to the material.  The following schedule should be seen as a high-level guide to what we'll do in 8 lectures, but is not set in stone.  Please check regularly, as lectures are added as we progress.

To download the notebooks, right-click the ipynb link and click "save as." You can also access the notebooks using the Colab link.
