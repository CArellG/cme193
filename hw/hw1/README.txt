Instructions: 
--------------

Edit the code inside matrix.py and create a minimal matrix class. PLEASE do read the comments and post to Piazza with questions.

To test your code, type:

python run.py

which imports and runs your matrix code. There is a minimal set of tests that you can take a look at in run.py

Over the weekend, more tests will be released that will test addition and multiplication.

Evaluation:
-----------

You're evaluated on two criteria:

	1) performance on the tests (10 pts for ten tests)
	2) coding style and effort (10 pts)

The tests will be very similar to the ones currently in run.py plus the ones that will be released over the weekend.
